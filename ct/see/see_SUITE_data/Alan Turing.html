        Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an
        English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and
        theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the development of
        theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of
        algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a
        model of a general purpose computer.^[2]^[3]^[4] Turing is widely considered to
        be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.^[5]

        During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher
        School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre. For a time he
        led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a
        number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including
        improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine
        that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role
        in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the
        Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic; it has
        been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two
        years and saved over fourteen million lives.^[6]

        After the war, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed
        the ACE, among the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948 Turing
        joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of
        Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers^[7] and became
        interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of
        morphogenesis, and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the
        Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.

        Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when by the Labouchere
        Amendment, "gross indecency" was still criminal in the UK. He accepted chemical
        castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in
        1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest
        determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence
        is also consistent with accidental poisoning.^[8] In 2009, following an
        Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public
        apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was
        treated." Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013.^[9]^[10]^
