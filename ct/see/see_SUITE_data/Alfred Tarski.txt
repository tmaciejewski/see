Alfred Tarski (/ˈtɑːrski/; January 14, 1901 – October 26, 1983) was a Polish
logician, mathematician and philosopher. Educated at the University of Warsaw
and a member of the Lwów–Warsaw school of logic and the Warsaw school of
mathematics and philosophy, he immigrated to the USA in 1939 where he became a
naturalized citizen in 1945, and taught and carried out research in mathematics
at the University of California, Berkeley from 1942 until his death.^[1]

A prolific author best known for his work on model theory, metamathematics, and
algebraic logic, he also contributed to abstract algebra, topology, geometry,
measure theory, mathematical logic, set theory, and analytic philosophy.

His biographers Anita and Solomon Feferman state that, "Along with his
contemporary, Kurt Gödel, he changed the face of logic in the twentieth
century, especially through his work on the concept of truth and the theory of
models."^[2]

Life[edit]

Alfred Tarski was born Alfred Teitelbaum (Polish spelling: "Tajtelbaum"), to
parents who were Polish Jews in comfortable circumstances. He first manifested
his mathematical abilities while in secondary school, at Warsaw's Szkoła
Mazowiecka.^[3] Nevertheless, he entered the University of Warsaw in 1918
intending to study biology.^[4]

After Poland regained independence in 1918, Warsaw University came under the
leadership of Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski and Wacław Sierpiński and
quickly became a world-leading research institution in logic, foundational
mathematics, and the philosophy of mathematics. Leśniewski recognized Tarski's
potential as a mathematician and encouraged him to abandon biology.^[4]
Henceforth Tarski attended courses taught by Łukasiewicz, Sierpiński, Stefan
Mazurkiewicz and Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and became the only person ever to
complete a doctorate under Leśniewski's supervision. Tarski and Leśniewski soon
grew cool to each other. However, in later life, Tarski reserved his warmest
praise for Kotarbiński, as was mutual.

In 1923, Alfred Teitelbaum and his brother Wacław changed their surname to
"Tarski." (Years later, Alfred met another Alfred Tarski in northern
California.) The Tarski brothers also converted to Roman Catholicism, Poland's
dominant religion. Alfred did so even though he was an avowed atheist.^[5]^[6]
Tarski was a Polish nationalist who saw himself as a Pole and wished to be
fully accepted as such — later, in America, he spoke Polish at home.

After becoming the youngest person ever to complete a doctorate at Warsaw
University, Tarski taught logic at the Polish Pedagogical Institute,
mathematics and logic at the University, and served as Łukasiewicz's assistant.
Because these positions were poorly paid, Tarski also taught mathematics at a
Warsaw secondary school;^[7] before World War II, it was not uncommon for
European intellectuals of research caliber to teach high school. Hence between
1923 and his departure for the United States in 1939, Tarski not only wrote
several textbooks and many papers, a number of them ground-breaking, but also
did so while supporting himself primarily by teaching high-school mathematics.
In 1929 Tarski married fellow teacher Maria Witkowska, a Pole of Catholic
background. She had worked as a courier for the army in the Polish-Soviet War.
They had two children; a son Jan who became a physicist, and a daughter Ina who
married the mathematician Andrzej Ehrenfeucht.^[8]

Tarski applied for a chair of philosophy at Lwów University, but on Bertrand
Russell's recommendation it was awarded to Leon Chwistek.^[9] In 1930, Tarski
visited the University of Vienna, lectured to Karl Menger's colloquium, and met
Kurt Gödel. Thanks to a fellowship, he was able to return to Vienna during the
first half of 1935 to work with Menger's research group. From Vienna he
traveled to Paris to present his ideas on truth at the first meeting of the
Unity of Science movement, an outgrowth of the Vienna Circle. In 1937, Tarski
applied for a chair at Poznań University but the chair was abolished.^[10]
Tarski's ties to the Unity of Science movement likely saved his life, because
they resulted in his being invited to address the Unity of Science Congress
held in September 1939 at Harvard University. Thus he left Poland in August
1939, on the last ship to sail from Poland for the United States before the
German and Soviet invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II. Tarski
left reluctantly, because Leśniewski had died a few months before, creating a
vacancy which Tarski hoped to fill. Oblivious to the Nazi threat, he left his
wife and children in Warsaw. He did not see them again until 1946. During the
war, nearly all his extended family died at the hands of the German occupying
authorities.

Once in the United States, Tarski held a number of temporary teaching and
research positions: Harvard University (1939), City College of New York (1940),
and thanks to a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton (1942), where he again met Gödel. In 1942, Tarski joined the
Mathematics Department at the University of California, Berkeley, where he
spent the rest of his career. Tarski became an American citizen in 1945.^[11]
Although emeritus from 1968, he taught until 1973 and supervised Ph.D.
candidates until his death.^[12] At Berkeley, Tarski acquired a reputation as
an awesome and demanding teacher, a fact noted by many observers:

    His seminars at Berkeley quickly became famous in the world of mathematical
    logic. His students, many of whom became distinguished mathematicians,
    noted the awesome energy with which he would coax and cajole their best
    work out of them, always demanding the highest standards of clarity and
    precision.^[13]

    Tarski was extroverted, quick-witted, strong-willed, energetic, and
    sharp-tongued. He preferred his research to be collaborative — sometimes
    working all night with a colleague — and was very fastidious about
    priority.^[14]

    A charismatic leader and teacher, known for his brilliantly precise yet
    suspenseful expository style, Tarski had intimidatingly high standards for
    students, but at the same time he could be very encouraging, and
    particularly so to women — in contrast to the general trend. Some students
    were frightened away, but a circle of disciples remained, many of whom
    became world-renowned leaders in the field.^[15]

Tarski supervised twenty-four Ph.D. dissertations including (in chronological
order) those of Andrzej Mostowski, Bjarni Jónsson, Julia Robinson, Robert
Vaught, Solomon Feferman, Richard Montague, James Donald Monk, Haim Gaifman,
Donald Pigozzi and Roger Maddux, as well as Chen Chung Chang and Jerome Keisler
, authors of Model Theory (1973),^[16] a classic text in the field.^[17]^[18]
He also strongly influenced the dissertations of Alfred Lindenbaum, Dana Scott,
and Steven Givant. Five of Tarski's students were women, a remarkable fact
given that men represented an overwhelming majority of graduate students at the
time.^[18]

Tarski lectured at University College, London (1950, 1966), the Institut Henri
Poincaré in Paris (1955), the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science in
Berkeley (1958–60), the University of California at Los Angeles (1967), and the
Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (1974–75). Among many distinctions
garnered over the course of his career, Tarski was elected to the United States
National Academy of Sciences, the British Academy and the Royal Netherlands
Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958,^[19] received honorary degrees from the
Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in 1975, from Marseilles' Paul Cézanne
University in 1977 and from the University of Calgary, as well as the Berkeley
Citation in 1981. Tarski presided over the Association for Symbolic Logic,
1944–46, and the International Union for the History and Philosophy of Science,
1956–57. He was also an honorary editor of Algebra Universalis.^[20]

Mathematician[edit]

Tarski's mathematical interests were exceptionally broad. His collected papers
run to about 2,500 pages, most of them on mathematics, not logic. For a concise
survey of Tarski's mathematical and logical accomplishments by his former
student Solomon Feferman, see "Interludes I–VI" in Feferman and Feferman.^[21]

Tarski's first paper, published when he was 19 years old, was on set theory, a
subject to which he returned throughout his life. In 1924, he and Stefan Banach
proved that, if one accepts the Axiom of Choice, a ball can be cut into a
finite number of pieces, and then reassembled into a ball of larger size, or
alternatively it can be reassembled into two balls whose sizes each equal that
of the original one. This result is now called the Banach–Tarski paradox.

In A decision method for elementary algebra and geometry, Tarski showed, by the
method of quantifier elimination, that the first-order theory of the real
numbers under addition and multiplication is decidable. (While this result
appeared only in 1948, it dates back to 1930 and was mentioned in Tarski
(1931).) This is a very curious result, because Alonzo Church proved in 1936
that Peano arithmetic (the theory of natural numbers) is not decidable. Peano
arithmetic is also incomplete by Gödel's incompleteness theorem. In his 1953
Undecidable theories, Tarski et al. showed that many mathematical systems,
including lattice theory, abstract projective geometry, and closure algebras,
are all undecidable. The theory of Abelian groups is decidable, but that of
non-Abelian groups is not.

In the 1920s and 30s, Tarski often taught high school geometry. Using some
ideas of Mario Pieri, in 1926 Tarski devised an original axiomatization for
plane Euclidean geometry, one considerably more concise than Hilbert's.
Tarski's axioms form a first-order theory devoid of set theory, whose
individuals are points, and having only two primitive relations. In 1930, he
proved this theory decidable because it can be mapped into another theory he
had already proved decidable, namely his first-order theory of the real
numbers.

In 1929 he showed that much of Euclidean solid geometry could be recast as a
first-order theory whose individuals are spheres (a primitive notion), a single
primitive binary relation "is contained in", and two axioms that, among other
things, imply that containment partially orders the spheres. Relaxing the
requirement that all individuals be spheres yields a formalization of mereology
far easier to exposit than Lesniewski's variant. Near the end of his life,
Tarski wrote a very long letter, published as Tarski and Givant (1999),
summarizing his work on geometry.

Cardinal Algebras studied algebras whose models include the arithmetic of
cardinal numbers. Ordinal Algebras sets out an algebra for the additive theory
of order types. Cardinal, but not ordinal, addition commutes.

In 1941, Tarski published an important paper on binary relations, which began
the work on relation algebra and its metamathematics that occupied Tarski and
his students for much of the balance of his life. While that exploration (and
the closely related work of Roger Lyndon) uncovered some important limitations
of relation algebra, Tarski also showed (Tarski and Givant 1987) that relation
algebra can express most axiomatic set theory and Peano arithmetic. For an
introduction to relation algebra, see Maddux (2006). In the late 1940s, Tarski
and his students devised cylindric algebras, which are to first-order logic
what the two-element Boolean algebra is to classical sentential logic. This
work culminated in the two monographs by Tarski, Henkin, and Monk (1971, 1985).

Logician[edit]

Tarski's student, Vaught, has ranked Tarski as one of the four greatest
logicians of all time — along with Aristotle, Gottlob Frege, and Kurt Gödel.^
[2]^[22]^[23] However, Tarski often expressed great admiration for Charles
Sanders Peirce, particularly for his pioneering work in the logic of relations.

Tarski produced axioms for logical consequence, and worked on deductive systems
, the algebra of logic, and the theory of definability. His semantic methods,
which culminated in the model theory he and a number of his Berkeley students
developed in the 1950s and 60s, radically transformed Hilbert's proof-theoretic
metamathematics.

    In [Tarski's] view, metamathematics became similar to any mathematical
    discipline. Not only its concepts and results can be mathematized, but they
    actually can be integrated into mathematics. ... Tarski destroyed the
    borderline between metamathematics and mathematics. He objected to
    restricting the role of metamathematics to the foundations of mathematics.^
    [24]

Tarski's 1936 article "On the concept of logical consequence" argued that the
conclusion of an argument will follow logically from its premises if and only
if every model of the premises is a model of the conclusion. In 1937, he
published a paper presenting clearly his views on the nature and purpose of the
deductive method, and the role of logic in scientific studies. His high school
and undergraduate teaching on logic and axiomatics culminated in a classic
short text, published first in Polish, then in German translation, and finally
in a 1941 English translation as Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology
of Deductive Sciences.

Tarski's 1969 "Truth and proof" considered both Gödel's incompleteness theorems
and Tarski's undefinability theorem, and mulled over their consequences for the
axiomatic method in mathematics.

Truth in formalized languages[edit]

Main article: Semantic theory of truth

In 1933, Tarski published a very long paper in Polish, titled "Pojęcie prawdy w
językach nauk dedukcyjnych",^[25] setting out a mathematical definition of
truth for formal languages. The 1935 German translation was titled "Der
Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen", "The concept of truth in
formalized languages", sometimes shortened to "Wahrheitsbegriff". An English
translation appeared in the 1956 first edition of the volume Logic, Semantics,
Metamathematics. This collection of papers from 1923 to 1938 is an event in
20th-century analytic philosophy, a contribution to symbolic logic, semantics,
and the philosophy of language. For a brief discussion of its content, see
Convention T (and also T-schema).

Some recent philosophical debate examines the extent to which Tarski's theory
of truth for formalized languages can be seen as a correspondence theory of
truth. The debate centers on how to read Tarski's condition of material
adequacy for a truth definition. That condition requires that the truth theory
have the following as theorems for all sentences p of the language for which
truth is being defined:

    "p" is true if and only if p.

(where p is the proposition expressed by "p")

The debate amounts to whether to read sentences of this form, such as

    "Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white

as expressing merely a deflationary theory of truth or as embodying truth as a
more substantial property (see Kirkham 1992). It is important to realize that
Tarski's theory of truth is for formalized languages, so examples in natural
language are not illustrations of the use of Tarski's theory of truth.

Logical consequence[edit]

In 1936, Tarski published Polish and German versions of a lecture he had given
the preceding year at the International Congress of Scientific Philosophy in
Paris. A new English translation of this paper, Tarski (2002), highlights the
many differences between the German and Polish versions of the paper, and
corrects a number of mistranslations in Tarski (1983).

This publication set out the modern model-theoretic definition of (semantic)
logical consequence, or at least the basis for it. Whether Tarski's notion was
entirely the modern one turns on whether he intended to admit models with
varying domains (and in particular, models with domains of different
cardinalities). This question is a matter of some debate in the current
philosophical literature. John Etchemendy stimulated much of the recent
discussion about Tarski's treatment of varying domains.^[26]

Tarski ends by pointing out that his definition of logical consequence depends
upon a division of terms into the logical and the extra-logical and he
expresses some skepticism that any such objective division will be forthcoming.
"What are Logical Notions?" can thus be viewed as continuing "On the Concept of
Logical Consequence".

Work on logical notions[edit]

Another theory of Tarski's attracting attention in the recent philosophical
literature is that outlined in his "What are Logical Notions?" (Tarski 1986).
This is the published version of a talk that he gave originally in 1966 in
London and later in 1973 in Buffalo; it was edited without his direct
involvement by John Corcoran. It became the most cited paper in the journal
History and Philosophy of Logic.^[27]

In the talk, Tarski proposed a demarcation of the logical operations (which he
calls "notions") from the non-logical. The suggested criteria were derived from
the Erlangen programme of the German 19th century Mathematician, Felix Klein.
Mautner, in 1946, and possibly an article by the Portuguese mathematician
Sebastiao e Silva, anticipated Tarski in applying the Erlangen Program to
logic.

That program classified the various types of geometry (Euclidean geometry,
affine geometry, topology, etc.) by the type of one-one transformation of space
onto itself that left the objects of that geometrical theory invariant. (A
one-to-one transformation is a functional map of the space onto itself so that
every point of the space is associated with or mapped to one other point of the
space. So, "rotate 30 degrees" and "magnify by a factor of 2" are intuitive
descriptions of simple uniform one-one transformations.) Continuous
transformations give rise to the objects of topology, similarity
transformations to those of Euclidean geometry, and so on.

As the range of permissible transformations becomes broader, the range of
objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by the application of the
transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow
(they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to
distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from
non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively
be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching,
compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to
distinguish a polygon from an annulus (ring with a hole in the centre), but do
not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.

Tarski's proposal was to demarcate the logical notions by considering all
possible one-to-one transformations (automorphisms) of a domain onto itself. By
domain is meant the universe of discourse of a model for the semantic theory of
a logic. If one identifies the truth value True with the domain set and the
truth-value False with the empty set, then the following operations are counted
as logical under the proposal:

 1. Truth-functions: All truth-functions are admitted by the proposal. This
    includes, but is not limited to, all n-ary truth-functions for finite n.
    (It also admits of truth-functions with any infinite number of places.)
 2. Individuals: No individuals, provided the domain has at least two members.
 3. Predicates:
      □ the one-place total and null predicates, the former having all members
        of the domain in its extension and the latter having no members of the
        domain in its extension
      □ two-place total and null predicates, the former having the set of all
        ordered pairs of domain members as its extension and the latter with
        the empty set as extension
      □ the two-place identity predicate, with the set of all order-pairs <a,a>
        in its extension, where a is a member of the domain
      □ the two-place diversity predicate, with the set of all order pairs <a,b
        > where a and b are distinct members of the domain
      □ n-ary predicates in general: all predicates definable from the identity
        predicate together with conjunction, disjunction and negation (up to
        any ordinality, finite or infinite)
 4. Quantifiers: Tarski explicitly discusses only monadic quantifiers and
    points out that all such numerical quantifiers are admitted under his
    proposal. These include the standard universal and existential quantifiers
    as well as numerical quantifiers such as "Exactly four", "Finitely many",
    "Uncountably many", and "Between four and 9 million", for example. While
    Tarski does not enter into the issue, it is also clear that polyadic
    quantifiers are admitted under the proposal. These are quantifiers like,
    given two predicates Fx and Gy, "More(x, y)", which says "More things have
    F than have G."
 5. Set-Theoretic relations: Relations such as inclusion, intersection and
    union applied to subsets of the domain are logical in the present sense.
 6. Set membership: Tarski ended his lecture with a discussion of whether the
    set membership relation counted as logical in his sense. (Given the
    reduction of (most of) mathematics to set theory, this was, in effect, the
    question of whether most or all of mathematics is a part of logic.) He
    pointed out that set membership is logical if set theory is developed along
    the lines of type theory, but is extralogical if set theory is set out
    axiomatically, as in the canonical Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.
 7. Logical notions of higher order: While Tarski confined his discussion to
    operations of first-order logic, there is nothing about his proposal that
    necessarily restricts it to first-order logic. (Tarski likely restricted
    his attention to first-order notions as the talk was given to a
    non-technical audience.) So, higher-order quantifiers and predicates are
    admitted as well.

In some ways the present proposal is the obverse of that of Lindenbaum and
Tarski (1936), who proved that all the logical operations of Russell and
Whitehead's Principia Mathematica are invariant under one-to-one
transformations of the domain onto itself. The present proposal is also
employed in Tarski and Givant (1987).

Solomon Feferman and Vann McGee further discussed Tarski's proposal in work
published after his death. Feferman (1999) raises problems for the proposal and
suggests a cure: replacing Tarski's preservation by automorphisms with
preservation by arbitrary homomorphisms. In essence, this suggestion
circumvents the difficulty Tarski's proposal has in dealing with sameness of
logical operation across distinct domains of a given cardinality and across
domains of distinct cardinalities. Feferman's proposal results in a radical
restriction of logical terms as compared to Tarski's original proposal. In
particular, it ends up counting as logical only those operators of standard
first-order logic without identity.

McGee (1996) provides a precise account of what operations are logical in the
sense of Tarski's proposal in terms of expressibility in a language that
extends first-order logic by allowing arbitrarily long conjunctions and
disjunctions, and quantification over arbitrarily many variables. "Arbitrarily"
includes a countable infinity.

    and Tarski's political allegiance was socialist at the time. So, along with
    its being a practical move, becoming more Polish than Jewish was an
    ideological statement and was approved by many, though not all, of his
    colleagues. As to why Tarski, a professed atheist, converted, that just
    came with the territory and was part of the package: if you were going to
    be Polish then you had to say you were Catholic." Anita Burdman Feferman,

Logic literature

  • The December 1986 issue of the Journal of Symbolic Logic surveys Tarski's
    work on model theory (Robert Vaught), algebra (Jonsson), undecidable
    theories (McNulty), algebraic logic (Donald Monk), and geometry (Szczerba).
    The March 1988 issue of the same journal surveys his work on axiomatic set
    theory (Azriel Levy), real closed fields (Lou Van Den Dries), decidable
    theory (Doner and Wilfrid Hodges), metamathematics (Blok and Pigozzi),
    truth and logical consequence (John Etchemendy), and general philosophy
    (Patrick Suppes).
