Frédéric François Chopin (/ˈʃoʊpæn/; French: [fʁedeʁik fʁɑ̃swa ʃɔpɛ̃]; 1 March
1810 – 17 October 1849), born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin,^[n 1] was a Polish
composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era who wrote primarily for the
solo piano. He gained and has maintained renown worldwide as a leading musician
of his era, whose "poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was
without equal in his generation."^[1] Chopin was born in what was then the
Duchy of Warsaw and grew up in Warsaw, which in 1815 became part of Congress
Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his
earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a
month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising.

At 21 he settled in Paris. Thereafter, during the last 18 years of his life, he
gave only some 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere
of the salon. He supported himself by selling his compositions and by teaching
piano, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz
Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert
Schumann. In 1835 he obtained French citizenship. After a failed engagement to
Maria Wodzińska, from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship
with the French woman writer George Sand. A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca
with Sand in 1838–39 was one of his most productive periods of composition. In
his last years, he was financially supported by his admirer Jane Stirling, who
also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. Through most of his life,
Chopin suffered from poor health. He died in Paris in 1849, at the age of 39,
probably of tuberculosis.

All of Chopin's compositions include the piano. Most are for solo piano, though
he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some songs to
Polish lyrics. His keyboard style is highly individual and often technically
demanding; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity.
Chopin invented the concept of the instrumental ballade. His major piano works
also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, études, impromptus,
scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only after his death. Influences
on his composition style include Polish folk music, the classical tradition of
J. S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, the music of all of whom he admired, as well
as the Paris salons where he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style,
musical form, and harmony, and his association of music with nationalism, were
influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.

Chopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest superstars, his
association (if only indirect) with political insurrection, his love life and
his early death have made him a leading symbol of the Romantic era in the
public consciousness. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of
numerous films and biographies of varying degrees of historical accuracy.

Life

Childhood

[180px-Miko]
 
Chopin's father, Nicolas Chopin, by Mieroszewski, 1829

Fryderyk Chopin was born in Żelazowa Wola,^[2] 46 kilometres (29 miles) west of
Warsaw, in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, a Polish state established by
Napoleon. The parish baptismal record gives his birthday as 22 February 1810,
and cites his given names in the Latin form Fridericus Franciscus^[2] (in
Polish, he was Fryderyk Franciszek).^[3] However, the composer and his family
used the birthdate 1 March,^[n 2]^[2] which is now generally accepted as the
correct date.^[5]

Fryderyk's father, Nicolas Chopin, was a Frenchman from Lorraine who had
emigrated to Poland in 1787 at the age of sixteen.^[6] Nicolas tutored children
of the Polish aristocracy, and in 1806 married Justyna Krzyżanowska,^[7] a poor
relative of the Skarbeks, one of the families for whom he worked.^[8] Fryderyk
was baptized on Easter Sunday, 23 April 1810, in the same church where his
parents had married, in Brochów.^[2] His eighteen-year-old godfather, for whom
he was named, was Fryderyk Skarbek, a pupil of Nicolas Chopin.^[2] Fryderyk was
the couple's second child and only son; he had an elder sister, Ludwika
(1807–55), and two younger sisters, Izabela (1811–81) and Emilia (1812–27).^[9]
Nicolas was devoted to his adopted homeland, and insisted on the use of the
Polish language in the household.^[2]

In October 1810, six months after Fryderyk's birth, the family moved to Warsaw,
where his father acquired a post teaching French at the Warsaw Lyceum, then
housed in the Saxon Palace. Fryderyk lived with his family in the Palace
grounds. The father played the flute and violin;^[10] the mother played the
piano and gave lessons to boys in the boarding house that the Chopins kept.^
[11] Chopin was of slight build, and even in early childhood was prone to
illnesses.^[12]

Fryderyk may have had some piano instruction from his mother, but his first
professional music tutor, from 1816 to 1821, was the Czech pianist Wojciech
Żywny.^[13] His elder sister Ludwika also took lessons from Żywny, and
occasionally played duets with her brother.^[14] It quickly became apparent
that he was a child prodigy. By the age of seven Fryderyk had begun giving
public concerts, and in 1817 he composed two polonaises, in G minor and B-flat
major.^[15] His next work, a polonaise in A-flat major of 1821, dedicated to
Żywny, is his earliest surviving musical manuscript.^[13]

In 1817 the Saxon Palace was requisitioned by Warsaw's Russian governor for
military use, and the Warsaw Lyceum was reestablished in the Kazimierz Palace
(today the rectorate of Warsaw University). Fryderyk and his family moved to a
building, which still survives, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace. During this
period, Fryderyk was sometimes invited to the Belweder Palace as playmate to
the son of the ruler of Russian Poland, Grand Duke Constantine; he played the
piano for the Duke and composed a march for him. Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, in
his dramatic eclogue, "Nasze Przebiegi" ("Our Discourses", 1818), attested to
"little Chopin's" popularity.^[16]

Education

[180px-J]
 
Józef Elsner after 1853

From September 1823 to 1826, Chopin attended the Warsaw Lyceum, where he
received organ lessons from the Czech musician Wilhelm Würfel during his first
year. In the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the Silesian
composer Józef Elsner at the Warsaw Conservatory, studying music theory,
figured bass and composition.^[17]^[n 3] Throughout this period he continued to
compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in Warsaw. He was engaged
by the inventors of a mechanical organ, the "eolomelodicon", and on this
instrument in May 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a
concerto by Moscheles. The success of this concert led to an invitation to give
a similar recital on the instrument before Tsar Alexander I, who was visiting
Warsaw; the Tsar presented him with a diamond ring. At a subsequent
eolomelodicon concert on 10 June 1825, Chopin performed his Rondo Op. 1. This
was the first of his works to be commercially published and earned him his
first mention in the foreign press, when the Leipzig Allgemeine Musikalische
Zeitung praised his "wealth of musical ideas".^[18]

During 1824–28 Chopin spent his vacations away from Warsaw, at a number of
locales.^[n 4] In 1824 and 1825, at Szafarnia, he was a guest of Dominik
Dziewanowski, the father of a schoolmate. Here for the first time he
encountered Polish rural folk music.^[20] His letters home from Szafarnia (to
which he gave the title "The Szafarnia Courier"), written in a very modern and
lively Polish, amused his family with their spoofing of the Warsaw newspapers
and demonstrated the youngster's literary gift.^[21]

In 1827, soon after the death of Chopin's youngest sister Emilia, the family
moved from the Warsaw University building, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace, to
lodgings just across the street from the university, in the south annex of the
Krasiński Palace on Krakowskie Przedmieście,^[n 5] where Chopin lived until he
left Warsaw in 1830.^[n 6] Here his parents continued running their boarding
house for male students; the Chopin Family Parlour (Salonik Chopinów) became a
museum in the 20th century. In 1829 the artist Ambroży Mieroszewski executed a
set of portraits of Chopin family members, including the first known portrait
of the composer.^[n 7]

Four boarders at his parents' apartments became Chopin's intimates: Tytus
Woyciechowski, Jan Nepomucen Białobłocki, Jan Matuszyński and Julian Fontana;
the latter two would become part of his Paris milieu. He was friendly with
members of Warsaw's young artistic and intellectual world, including Fontana,
Józef Bohdan Zaleski and Stefan Witwicki.^[24] He was also attracted to the
singing student Konstancja Gładkowska. In letters to Woyciechowski, he
indicated which of his works, and even which of their passages, were influenced
by his fascination with her; his letter of 15 May 1830 revealed that the slow
movement (Larghetto) of his Piano Concerto No. 1 (in E minor) was secretly
dedicated to her – "It should be like dreaming in beautiful springtime – by
moonlight."^[25] His final Conservatory report (July 1829) read: "Chopin F.,
third-year student, exceptional talent, musical genius."^[17]

Travel and domestic success

[240px-Chopin_concert]
 
Chopin plays for the Radziwiłłs, 1829 (painting by Henryk Siemiradzki, 1887)

In September 1828 Chopin, while still a student, visited Berlin with a family
friend, zoologist Feliks Jarocki, enjoying operas directed by Gaspare Spontini
and attending concerts by Carl Friedrich Zelter, Felix Mendelssohn and other
celebrities. On an 1829 return trip to Berlin, he was a guest of Prince Antoni
Radziwiłł, governor of the Grand Duchy of Posen—himself an accomplished
composer and aspiring cellist. For the prince and his pianist daughter Wanda,
he composed his Introduction and Polonaise brillante in C major for cello and
piano, Op. 3.^[26]

Back in Warsaw that year, Chopin heard Niccolò Paganini play the violin, and
composed a set of variations, Souvenir de Paganini. It may have been this
experience which encouraged him to commence writing his first Études,
(1829–32), exploring the capacities of his own instrument.^[27] On 11 August,
three weeks after completing his studies at the Warsaw Conservatory, he made
his debut in Vienna. He gave two piano concerts and received many favourable
reviews—in addition to some commenting (in Chopin's own words) that he was "too
delicate for those accustomed to the piano-bashing of local artists". In one of
these concerts, he premiered his Variations on Là ci darem la mano, Op. 2
(variations on an aria from Mozart's opera Don Giovanni) for piano and
orchestra.^[28] He returned to Warsaw in September 1829,^[29] where he
premiered his Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor, Op. 21 on 17 March 1830.^[17]

Chopin's successes as a composer and performer opened the door to western
Europe for him, and on 2 November 1830, he set out, in the words of Zdzisław
Jachimecki, "into the wide world, with no very clearly defined aim, forever."^
[30] With Woyciechowski, he headed for Austria again, intending to go on to
Italy. Later that month, in Warsaw, the November 1830 Uprising broke out, and
Woyciechowski returned to Poland to enlist. Chopin, now alone in Vienna, was
nostalgic for his homeland, and wrote to a friend, "I curse the moment of my
departure."^[31] When in September 1831 he learned, while travelling from
Vienna to Paris, that the uprising had been crushed, he expressed his anguish
in the pages of his private journal: "Oh God! ... You are there, and yet you do
not take vengeance!"^[32] Jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer's
maturing "into an inspired national bard who intuited the past, present and
future of his native Poland."^[30]

Paris

[180px-Chopin]

Chopin arrived in Paris in late September 1831; he would never return to
Poland,^[33] thus becoming one of many expatriates of the Polish Great
Emigration. In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after
receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport.^[34]
However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and
confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's
biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be French,
despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.^[35]

In Paris, Chopin encountered artists and other distinguished figures, and found
many opportunities to exercise his talents and achieve celebrity. During his
years in Paris he was to become acquainted with, among many others, Hector
Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Ferdinand Hiller, Heinrich Heine, Eugène Delacroix, and
Alfred de Vigny.^[36] Chopin was also acquainted with the poet Adam Mickiewicz,
principal of the Polish Literary Society, some of whose verses he set as songs.
^[37]

Two Polish friends in Paris were also to play important roles in Chopin's life
there. His fellow student at the Warsaw Conservatory, Julian Fontana, had
originally tried unsuccessfully to establish himself in England; Albert
Grzymała, who in Paris became a wealthy financier and society figure, often
acted as Chopin's adviser and "gradually began to fill the role of elder
brother in [his] life."^[38] Fontana was to become, in the words of Michałowski
and Samson, Chopin's "general factotum and copyist".^[39]

At the end of 1831, Chopin received the first major endorsement from an
outstanding contemporary when Robert Schumann, reviewing the Op. 2 Variations
in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung (his first published article on music),
declared: "Hats off, gentlemen! A genius."^[40] On 26 February 1832 Chopin gave
a debut Paris concert at the Salle Pleyel which drew universal admiration. The
critic François-Joseph Fétis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: "Here is a
young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of
piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere
else ..."^[41] After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially
intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later
that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose
patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings
of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite).^[42] By the end of 1832
Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned
the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer
depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832 he began
earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to
affluent students from all over Europe.^[43] This freed him from the strains of
public concert-giving, which he disliked.^[42]

Chopin seldom performed publicly in Paris. In later years he generally gave a
single annual concert at the Salle Pleyel, a venue that seated three hundred.
He played more frequently at salons, but preferred playing at his own Paris
apartment for small groups of friends. The musicologist Arthur Hedley has
observed that "As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the
highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances—few more than
thirty in the course of his lifetime."^[44] The list of musicians who took part
in some of his concerts provides an indication of the richness of Parisian
artistic life during this period. Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833,
in which Chopin, Liszt and Hiller performed (on pianos) a concerto by J.S. Bach
for three keyboards; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil
Adolphe Gutmann, Charles-Valentin Alkan, and Alkan's teacher Joseph Zimmermann
performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from Beethoven
's 7th symphony.^[45] Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's
Hexameron; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini's theme.
Chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted
with Maurice Schlesinger, who arranged for it to be published not only in
France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England.^[46]

In the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in
Aix-la-Chapelle with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix
Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited Düsseldorf, where
Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn
described as "a very agreeable day", playing and discussing music at his piano,
and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of
his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn.^[47] In
1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the
last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from
Warsaw, the Wodzińskis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in
Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to
stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to
Paris via Leipzig.^[48] The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is
considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses.^[49] In
October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and
Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St.
Paul, and who considered him "a perfect musician".^[50] In July 1836 Chopin
travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodziński family, and in
September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzińska approved in
principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G
minor Ballade.^[51] At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his
sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in
C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1.^[52] The anodyne thanks he received from Maria
proved to be the last letter he was to have from her.^[53]

Franz Liszt

[200px-Franz_Liszt_1839_Lith]

Although it is not known exactly when Chopin first met Liszt after arriving in
Paris, on 12 December 1831 he mentioned in a letter to his friend Woyciechowski
that "I have met Rossini, Cherubini, Baillot, etc.—also Kalkbrenner. You would
not believe how curious I was about Herz, Liszt, Hiller, etc."^[54] Liszt was
in attendance at Chopin's Parisian debut on 26 February 1832 at the Salle
Pleyel, which led him to remark: "The most vigorous applause seemed not to
suffice to our enthusiasm in the presence of this talented musician, who
revealed a new phase of poetic sentiment combined with such happy innovation in
the form of his art."^[55]

The two became friends, and for many years lived in close proximity in Paris,
Chopin at 38 Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, and Liszt at the Hôtel de France on
the Rue Lafitte, a few blocks away.^[56] They performed together on seven
occasions between 1833 and 1841. The first, on 2 April 1833, was at a benefit
concert organized by Hector Berlioz for his bankrupt Shakespearean actress wife
Harriet Smithson, during which they played George Onslow's Sonata in F minor
for piano duet.^[55] Later joint appearances included a benefit concert for the
Benevolent Association of Polish Ladies in Paris.^[55] Their last appearance
together in public was for a charity concert conducted for the Beethoven
Memorial in Bonn, held at the Salle Pleyel and the Paris Conservatory on 25 and
26 April 1841.^[55]

Although the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their
friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship.
Harold C. Schonberg believes that Chopin displayed a "tinge of jealousy and
spite" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano,^[56] and others have also
argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship and
success.^[57] Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 Études, and his
performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, "I should like to
rob him of the way he plays my studies."^[58] However, Chopin expressed
annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition
of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should
play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most
biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each
other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him
as "my friend Liszt".^[56] Some commentators point to events in the two men's
romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt
had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult's obsession with Chopin,
while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing
relationship with George Sand.^[55]

George Sand

[180px-Eug]

In 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author
George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin).^[56] Short (under five
feet, or 152 cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker,^[59] she initially
repelled Chopin, who remarked, "What an unattractive person la Sand is. Is she
really a woman?"^[60] However, by early 1837 Maria Wodzińska's mother had made
it clear to Chopin in correspondence that a marriage with her daughter was
unlikely to proceed.^[61] It is thought that she was influenced by his poor
health and possibly also by rumours about his associations with women such as
d'Agoult and Sand.^[62] Chopin finally placed the letters from Maria and her
mother in a package on which he wrote, in Polish, "My tragedy".^[63] Sand, in a
letter to Grzymała of June 1838, admitted strong feelings for the composer and
debated whether to abandon a current affair in order to begin a relationship
with Chopin; she asked Grzymała to assess Chopin's relationship with Maria
Wodzińska, without realising that the affair, at least from Maria's side, was
over.^[64]

In June 1837 Chopin visited London incognito in the company of the piano
manufacturer Camille Pleyel where he played at a musical soirée at the house of
English piano maker James Broadwood.^[65] On his return to Paris, his
association with Sand began in earnest, and by the end of June 1838 they had
become lovers.^[66] Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who
had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: "I must say I was confused and
amazed at the effect this little creature had on me ... I have still not
recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should be
feeling humiliated at having been carried away ..."^[67] The two spent a
miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where,
together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving
the health of Chopin and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to
escape the threats of Sand's former lover Félicien Mallefille.^[68] After
discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic
people of Majorca became inhospitable,^[69] making accommodation difficult to
find. This compelled the group to take lodgings in a former Carthusian
monastery in Valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter
weather.^[66]

On 3 December, Chopin complained about his bad health and the incompetence of
the doctors in Majorca: "Three doctors have visited me ... The first said I was
dead; the second said I was dying; and the third said I was about to die."^[70]
He also had problems having his Pleyel piano sent to him. It finally arrived
from Paris in December. Chopin wrote to Pleyel in January 1839: "I am sending
you my Preludes [(Op. 28)]. I finished them on your little piano, which arrived
in the best possible condition in spite of the sea, the bad weather and the
Palma customs."^[66] Chopin was also able to undertake work on his Ballade No.
2, Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.^[71]

Although this period had been productive, the bad weather had such a
detrimental effect on Chopin's health that Sand determined to leave the island.
To avoid further customs duties, Sand sold the piano to a local French couple,
the Canuts.^[72]^[n 8] The group traveled first to Barcelona, then to
Marseilles, where they stayed for a few months while Chopin convalesced.^[74]
In May 1839 they headed for the summer to Sand's estate at Nohant, where they
spent most summers until 1846. In autumn they returned to Paris, where Chopin's
apartment at 5 rue Tronchet was close to Sand's rented accommodation at the rue
Pigalle. He frequently visited Sand in the evenings, but both retained some
independence.^[75] In 1842 he and Sand moved to the Square d'Orléans, living in
adjacent buildings.^[76]

At the funeral of the tenor Adolphe Nourrit in Paris in 1839, Chopin made a
rare appearance at the organ, playing a transcription of Franz Schubert's lied
Die Gestirne.^[77] On 26 July 1840 Chopin and Sand were present at the dress
rehearsal of Berlioz's Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale, composed to
commemorate the tenth anniversary of the July Revolution. Chopin was reportedly
unimpressed with the composition.^[78]

During the summers at Nohant, particularly in the years 1839–43, Chopin found
quiet, productive days during which he composed many works, including his
Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53. Among the visitors to Nohant were Delacroix
and the mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, whom Chopin had advised on piano
technique and composition.^[79] Delacroix gives an account of staying at Nohant
in a letter of 7 June 1842:

    The hosts could not be more pleasant in entertaining me. When we are not
    all together at dinner, lunch, playing billiards, or walking, each of us
    stays in his room, reading or lounging around on a couch. Sometimes,
    through the window which opens on the garden, a gust of music wafts up from
    Chopin at work. All this mingles with the songs of nightingales and the
    fragrance of roses.^[80]

Decline

[150px-Eug]

From 1842 onwards, Chopin showed signs of serious illness. After a solo recital
in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: "I have to lie in bed all
day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much."^[81] He was forced by
illness to decline a written invitation from Alkan to participate in a repeat
performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Erard's on 1 March
1843.^[82] Late in 1844, Charles Hallé visited Chopin and found him "hardly
able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain",
although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his
visitor.^[83] Chopin's health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this
time onwards. Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he
may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.^[84]

Chopin's relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her
daughter Solange and Solange's fiancé, the young fortune-hunting sculptor
Auguste Clésinger.^[85] The composer frequently took Solange's side in quarrels
with her mother; he also faced jealousy from Sand's son Maurice.^[86] Chopin
was utterly indifferent to Sand's radical political pursuits, while Sand looked
on his society friends with disdain.^[87] As the composer's illness progressed,
Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin, whom she called
her "third child". In letters to third parties, she vented her impatience,
referring to him as a "child," a "little angel", a "sufferer" and a "beloved
little corpse."^[88] In 1847 Sand published her novel Lucrezia Floriani, whose
main characters—a rich actress and a prince in weak health—could be interpreted
as Sand and Chopin; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin, who could not have
missed the allusions as he helped Sand correct the printer's galleys. In 1847
he did not visit Nohant, and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship
following an angry correspondence which, in Sand's words, made "a strange
conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship."^[85] The two would never
meet again.^[89]

Chopin's output as a composer throughout this period declined in quantity year
by year. Whereas in 1841 he had written a dozen works, only six were written in
1842 and six shorter pieces in 1843. In 1844 he wrote only the Op. 58 sonata.
1845 saw the completion of three mazurkas (Op. 59). Although these works were
more refined than many of his earlier compositions, Zamoyski concludes that
"his powers of concentration were failing and his inspiration was beset by
anguish, both emotional and intellectual."^[90]

Tour of England and Scotland

Chopin's public popularity as a virtuoso began to wane, as did the number of
his pupils, and this, together with the political strife and instability of the
time, caused him to struggle financially.^[89] In February 1848, with the
cellist Auguste Franchomme, he gave his last Paris concert, which included
three movements of the Cello Sonata Op. 65.^[88]^[89]

In April, during the Revolution of 1848 in Paris, he left for London, where he
performed at several concerts and at numerous receptions in great houses.^[88]
This tour was suggested to him by his Scottish pupil Jane Stirling and her
elder sister. Stirling also made all the logistical arrangements and provided
much of the necessary funding.^[91]

In London Chopin took lodgings at Dover Street, where the firm of Broadwood
provided him with a grand piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at Stafford
House, the audience included Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Prince, who
was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's
technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were
Thackeray and the singer Jenny Lind. Chopin was also sought after for piano
lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one guinea (£1.05 in present
British currency) per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20
guineas. At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang
arrangements of some of his mazurkas to Spanish texts.^[92] On 28 August, he
played at a concert in Manchester's Concert Hall, sharing the stage with
Marietta Alboni and Lorenzo Salvi.^[93]

In late summer he was invited by Jane Stirling to visit Scotland, where he
stayed at Calder House near Edinburgh and at Johnstone Castle in Renfrewshire,
both owned by members of Stirling's family.^[94] She clearly had a notion of
going beyond mere friendship, and Chopin was obliged to make it clear to her
that this could not be so. He wrote at this time to Grzymała "My Scottish
ladies are kind, but such bores", and responding to a rumour about his
involvement, answered that he was "closer to the grave than the nuptial bed."^
[95] He gave a public concert in Glasgow on 27 September,^[96] and another in
Edinburgh, at the Hopetoun Rooms on Queen Street (now Erskine House) on 4
October.^[97] In late October 1848, while staying at 10 Warriston Crescent in
Edinburgh with the Polish physician Adam Łyszczyński, he wrote out his last
will and testament—"a kind of disposition to be made of my stuff in the future,
if I should drop dead somewhere", he wrote to Grzymała.^[88]

London's Guildhall, where Chopin gave his last public performance.

Chopin made his last public appearance on a concert platform at London's
Guildhall on 16 November 1848, when, in a final patriotic gesture, he played
for the benefit of Polish refugees. By this time he was very seriously ill,
weighing under 99 pounds (i.e. less than 45 kg), and his doctors were aware
that his sickness was at a terminal stage.^[98]

At the end of November, Chopin returned to Paris. He passed the winter in
unremitting illness, but gave occasional lessons and was visited by friends,
including Delacroix and Franchomme. Occasionally he played, or accompanied the
singing of Delfina Potocka, for his friends. During the summer of 1849, his
friends found him an apartment in Chaillot, out of the centre of the city, for
which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, Princess Obreskoff. Here
in June 1849 he was visited by Jenny Lind.^[99]

Death and funeral

Stirling. Chopin is in the presence of (from left) Aleksander Jełowicki,
Chopin's sister Ludwika, Princess Marcelina Czartoryska, Wojciech Grzymała,
Kwiatkowski.

With his health further deteriorating, Chopin desired to have a family member
with him. In June 1849 his sister Ludwika came to Paris with her husband and
daughter, and in September, supported by a loan from Jane Stirling, he took an
apartment at Place Vendôme 12.^[100] After 15 October, when his condition took
a marked turn for the worse, only a handful of his closest friends remained
with him, although Viardot remarked sardonically that "all the grand Parisian
ladies considered it de rigueur to faint in his room."^[98]

Some of his friends provided music at his request; among them, Potocka sang and
Franchomme played the cello. Chopin requested that his body be opened after
death (for fear of being buried alive) and his heart returned to Warsaw where
it rests at the Church of the Holy Cross.^[101] He also bequeathed his
unfinished notes on a piano tuition method, Projet de méthode, to Alkan for
completion.^[102] On 17 October, after midnight, the physician leaned over him
and asked whether he was suffering greatly. "No longer", he replied. He died a
few minutes before two o'clock in the morning. Those present at the deathbed
appear to have included his sister Ludwika, Princess Marcelina Czartoryska,
Sand's daughter Solange, and his close friend Thomas Albrecht. Later that
morning, Solange's husband Clésinger made Chopin's death mask and a cast of his
left hand.^[103]

Chopin's disease and the cause of his death have since been a matter of
discussion. His death certificate gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his
physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this
disease.^[104] Other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis
,^[105] cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency.^[106] However, the
attribution of tuberculosis as principal cause of death has not been disproved.
^[107] Permission for DNA testing, which could put the matter to rest, has been
denied by the Polish government.^[108]

[135px-Chopin_death]

The funeral, held at the Church of the Madeleine in Paris, was delayed almost
two weeks, until 30 October.^[109] Entrance was restricted to ticket holders^
[110] as many people were expected to attend.^[109] Over 3,000 people arrived
without invitations, from as far as London, Berlin and Vienna, and were
excluded.^[111]

Mozart's Requiem was sung at the funeral;^[110] the soloists were the soprano
Jeanne-Anais Castellan, the mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, the tenor Alexis
Dupont, and the bass Luigi Lablache; Chopin's Preludes No. 4 in E minor and
No. 6 in B minor were also played. The organist at the funeral was Louis
Lefébure-Wély.^[112] The funeral procession to Père Lachaise Cemetery, which
included Chopin's sister Ludwika, was led by the aged Prince Adam Czartoryski.
The pallbearers included Delacroix, Franchomme, and Camille Pleyel.^[113] At
the graveside, the Funeral March from Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 was played,
in Reber's instrumentation.^[114]

Chopin's tombstone, featuring the muse of music, Euterpe, weeping over a broken
lyre, was designed and sculpted by Clésinger. The expenses of the funeral and
monument, amounting to 5,000 francs, were covered by Jane Stirling, who also
paid for the return of the composer's sister Ludwika to Warsaw.^[113] Ludwika
took Chopin's heart in an urn, preserved in alcohol, back to Poland in 1850.^
[115]^[n 9] She also took a collection of two hundred letters from Sand to
Chopin; after 1851 these were returned to Sand, who seems to have destroyed
them.^[115]

Overview

[225px-Chopinamqsop53]
 
Autographed musical quotation from the Polonaise Op. 53, signed by Chopin on 25
May 1845

Over 230 works of Chopin survive; some compositions from early childhood have
been lost. All his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond
solo piano music, as either piano concertos, songs or chamber music.^[118]

Chopin was educated in the tradition of Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart and Clementi;
he used Clementi's piano method with his own students. He was also influenced
by Hummel's development of virtuoso, yet Mozartian, piano technique. He cited
Bach and Mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical
outlook.^[119] Chopin's early works are in the style of the "brilliant"
keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of Ignaz Moscheles,
Friedrich Kalkbrenner, and others. Less direct in the earlier period are the
influences of Polish folk music and of Italian opera. Much of what became his
typical style of ornamentation (for example, his fioriture) is taken from
singing. His melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the modes and
features of the music of his native country, such as drones.^[120]

Chopin took the new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish composer
John Field, to a deeper level of sophistication. He was the first to write
ballades^[121] and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially
established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op. 28,
published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the
concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt,
Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op. 10 published in 1833,
Op. 25 in 1837).^[122]

Chopin also endowed popular dance forms with a greater range of melody and
expression. Chopin's mazurkas, while originating in the traditional Polish
dance (the mazurek), differed from the traditional variety in that they were
written for the concert hall rather than the dance hall; "it was Chopin who put
the mazurka on the European musical map."^[123] The series of seven polonaises
published in his lifetime (another nine were published posthumously), beginning
with the Op. 26 pair (published 1836), set a new standard for music in the
form.^[124] His waltzes were also written specifically for the salon recital
rather than the ballroom and are frequently at rather faster tempos than their
dance-floor equivalents.^[125]

Titles, opus numbers and editions

Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as
the Revolutionary Étude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the Minute Waltz (Op. 64, No. 1).
However, with the exception of his Funeral March, the composer never named an
instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical
associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known
were invented by others.^[126] There is no evidence to suggest that the
Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia
in mind; it merely appeared at that time.^[127] The Funeral March, the third
movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35), the one case where he did give a title,
was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is
known to have inspired it.^[128]

The last opus number that Chopin himself used was 65, allocated to the Cello
Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished
manuscripts be destroyed. At the request of the composer's mother and sisters,
however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano
pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66–73), published
in 1855.^[129] In 1857, 17 Polish songs that Chopin wrote at various stages of
his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the
opus did not reflect the order of composition.^[130]

Works published since 1857 have received alternative catalogue designations
instead of opus numbers. The present standard musicological reference for
Chopin's works is the Kobylańska Catalogue (usually represented by the initials
'KK'), named for its compiler, the Polish musicologist Krystyna Kobylańska.^
[131]

Chopin's original publishers included Maurice Schlesinger and Camille Pleyel.^
[132] His works soon began to appear in popular 19th-century piano anthologies.
^[133] The first collected edition was by Breitkopf & Härtel (1878–1902).^[134]
Among modern scholarly editions of Chopin's works are the version under the
name of Paderewski published between 1937 and 1966 and the more recent Polish
"National Edition", edited by Jan Ekier, both of which contain detailed
explanations and discussions regarding choices and sources.^[135]^[136]

Chopin published his music in France, England and the German states due to the
copyright laws of the time. As such there are often three different kinds of
‘first editions’. Each edition is different from the other, as Chopin edited
them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing
it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including
autographs, annotated proofsheets and scribal copies. Only recently have these
differences gained greater recognition.^[137]

Form and harmony

[220px-Chopin_Museum_in_Warsaw_]

Museum, Warsaw

Improvisation stands at the centre of Chopin's creative processes. However,
this does not imply impulsive rambling: Nicholas Temperley writes that
"improvisation is designed for an audience, and its starting-point is that
audience's expectations, which include the current conventions of musical
form."^[138] The works for piano and orchestra, including the two concertos,
are held by Temperley to be "merely vehicles for brilliant piano playing ...
formally longwinded and extremely conservative".^[139] After the piano
concertos (which are both early, dating from 1830), Chopin made no attempts at
large-scale multi-movement forms, save for his late sonatas for piano and for
cello; "instead he achieved near-perfection in pieces of simple general design
but subtle and complex cell-structure."^[140] Rosen suggests that an important
aspect of Chopin's individuality is his flexible handling of the four-bar
phrase as a structural unit.^[141]

J. Barrie Jones suggests that "amongst the works that Chopin intended for
concert use, the four ballades and four scherzos stand supreme", and adds that
"the Barcarolle Op. 60 stands apart as an example of Chopin's rich harmonic
palette coupled with an Italianate warmth of melody."^[142] Temperley opines
that these works, which contain "immense variety of mood, thematic material and
structural detail", are based on an extended "departure and return" form; "the
more the middle section is extended, and the further it departs in key, mood
and theme, from the opening idea, the more important and dramatic is the
reprise when it at last comes."^[143]

Chopin's mazurkas and waltzes are all in straightforward ternary or episodic
form, sometimes with a coda.^[144] The mazurkas often show more folk features
than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies
and the use of drone basses. However, some also show unusual sophistication,
for example Op. 63 No. 3, which includes a canon at one beat's distance, a
great rarity in music.^[145]

Chopin's polonaises show a marked advance on those of his Polish predecessors
in the form (who included his teachers Zywny and Elsner). As with the
traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time and typically display
a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments and cadences. Unlike most of
their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.^[146]

The 21 nocturnes are more structured, and of greater emotional depth, than
those of Field (whom Chopin met in 1833). Many of the Chopin nocturnes have
middle sections marked by agitated expression (and often making very difficult
demands on the performer) which heightens their dramatic character.^[147]

Chopin's études are largely in straightforward ternary form.^[148] He used them
to teach his own technique of piano playing^[42]—for instance playing double
thirds (Op. 25, No. 6), playing in octaves (Op. 25, No. 10), and playing
repeated notes (Op. 10, No.  7).^[149]

The preludes, many of which are very brief (some consisting of simple
statements and developments of a single theme or figure), were described by
Schumann as "the beginnings of studies".^[150] Inspired by J.S. Bach's The
Well-Tempered Clavier, Chopin's preludes move up the circle of fifths (rather
than Bach's chromatic scale sequence) to create a prelude in each major and
minor tonality.^[151] The preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a
group, and may even have been used by him and later pianists as generic
preludes to others of his pieces, or even to music by other composers, as
Kenneth Hamilton suggests: he has noted a recording by Ferruccio Busoni of
1922, in which the Prelude Op. 28 No. 7 is followed by the Étude Op. 10 No. 5.^
[152]

The two mature piano sonatas (No. 2, Op. 35, written in 1839 and No. 3, Op. 58,
written in 1844) are in four movements. In Op. 35, Chopin was able to combine
within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano
technique—"a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style
and the German sonata principle".^[153] The last movement, a brief (75-bar)
perpetuum mobile in which the hands play in unmodified octave unison
throughout, was found shocking and unmusical by contemporaries, including
Schumann.^[154] The Op. 58 sonata is closer to the German tradition, including
many passages of complex counterpoint, "worthy of Brahms" according to the
music historians Kornel Michałowski and Jim Samson.^[153]

Chopin's harmonic innovations may have arisen partly from his keyboard
improvisation technique. Temperley says that in his works "novel harmonic
effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary appoggiaturas or
passing notes with melodic figures of accompaniment", and cadences are delayed
by the use of chords outside the home key (neapolitan sixths and diminished
sevenths), or by sudden shifts to remote keys. Chord progressions sometimes
anticipate the shifting tonality of later composers such as Claude Debussy, as
does Chopin's use of modal harmony.^[155]

Technique and performance style

[310px-Op_62-1ms]
 
Extract from Chopin Nocturne Op. 62 no. 1 (1846, composer's manuscript)
[310px-Chopin_op_62-1_pr]
 
The same passage (1881 Schirmer edition). The examples show typical use by
Chopin of trills, grace notes and detailed pedalling and tempo instructions.

In 1841, Léon Escudier wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, "One may
say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of
composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which
the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his
works full of originality, distinction and grace."^[156] Chopin refused to
conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set
technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very
independent finger technique. In his Projet de méthode he wrote: "Everything is
a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the
hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm."^[157] He further stated: "One
needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to
obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short
notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity."^[158] The
consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the
frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves
and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and
the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the
hands.^[159]

Jonathan Bellman writes that modern concert performance style—set in the "
conservatory" tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and
suitable for large auditoria or recordings—militates against what is known of
Chopin's more intimate performance technique.^[160] The composer himself said
to a pupil that "concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of
hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art."^[161] Contemporary
accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures
sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as "always crescendo to a high
note", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency
and sensitive colouring.^[162] Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin "has created a
kind of chromatic embroidery ... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to
be impossible to describe ... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this
music and give it this unusual turn".^[163] Hiller wrote that "What in the
hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful
wreath of flowers."^[164]

Chopin's music is frequently played with rubato, "the practice in performance
of disregarding strict time, 'robbing' some note-values for expressive effect".
^[165] There are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of rubato is
appropriate for his works. Charles Rosen comments that "most of the written-out
indications of rubato in Chopin are to be found in his mazurkas ... It is
probable that Chopin used the older form of rubato so important to Mozart ...
[where] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in
the bass ... An allied form of this rubato is the arpeggiation of the chords
thereby delaying the melody note; according to Chopin's pupil, Karol Mikuli,
Chopin was firmly opposed to this practice."^[166]

Friederike Müller, a pupil of Chopin, wrote: "[His] playing was always noble
and beautiful; his tones sang, whether in full forte or softest piano. He took
infinite pains to teach his pupils this legato, cantabile style of playing. His
most severe criticism was 'He—or she—does not know how to join two notes
together.' He also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm. He hated all
lingering and dragging, misplaced rubatos, as well as exaggerated ritardandos
 ... and it is precisely in this respect that people make such terrible errors
in playing his works."^[167]

Polish heritage

The "Polish character" of Chopin's work is unquestionable; not because he also
wrote polonaises and mazurkas ... which forms ... were often stuffed with alien
ideological and literary contents from the outside. ... As an artist he looked
for forms that stood apart from the literary-dramatic character of music which
was a feature of Romanticism, as a Pole he reflected in his work the very
essence of the tragic break in the history of the people and instinctively
aspired to give the deepest expression of his nation ... For he understood that
he could invest his music with the most enduring and truly Polish qualities
only by liberating art from the confines of dramatic and historical contents.
This attitude toward the question of "national music" – an inspired solution to
his art – was the reason why Chopin's works have come to be understood
everywhere outside of Poland ... Therein lies the strange riddle of his eternal
vigour.

Karol Szymanowski, 1923^[168]

With his mazurkas and polonaises, Chopin has been credited with introducing to
music a new sense of nationalism. Schumann, in his 1836 review of the piano
concertos, highlighted the composer's strong feelings for his native Poland,
writing that "Now that the Poles are in deep mourning [after the failure of the
November 1830 rising], their appeal to us artists is even stronger ... If the
mighty autocrat in the north [i.e. Nicholas I of Russia] could know that in
Chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous
enemy, he would place a ban on his music. Chopin's works are cannon buried in
flowers!"^[169] The biography of Chopin published in 1863 under the name of
Franz Liszt (but probably written by Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein)^[170]
claims that Chopin "must be ranked first among the first musicians ...
individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation."^[171]

Some modern commentators have argued against exaggerating Chopin's primacy as a
"nationalist" or "patriotic" composer. George Golos refers to earlier
"nationalist" composers in Central Europe, including Poland's Michał Kleofas
Ogiński and Franciszek Lessel, who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms.^[172]
Barbara Milewski suggests that Chopin's experience of Polish music came more
from "urbanised" Warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts (by
Jachimecki and others) to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are
without basis.^[173] Richard Taruskin impugns Schumann's attitude toward
Chopin's works as patronizing^[174] and comments that Chopin "felt his Polish
patriotism deeply and sincerely" but consciously modelled his works on the
tradition of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and Field.^[175]

A reconciliation of these views is suggested by William Atwood: "Undoubtedly
[Chopin's] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka
roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense of cohesiveness amongst those Poles
scattered across Europe and the New World ... While some sought solace in
[them], others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for
freedom. Although Chopin's music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather
than through any conscious patriotic design, it served all the same to
symbolize the will of the Polish people ..."^[176]

Reception and influence

heart

Jones comments that "Chopin's unique position as a composer, despite the fact
that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano, has rarely been
questioned."^[148] He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris
in 1831—"the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his
music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their
lessons"—and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his
contemporary and later reputation.^[125] While his illness and his love-affairs
conform to some of the stereotypes of romanticism, the rarity of his public
recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soirées) led Arthur
Hutchings to suggest that "his lack of Byronic flamboyance [and] his
aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional" among his romantic
contemporaries, such as Liszt and Henri Herz.^[140]

Chopin's qualities as a pianist and composer were recognized by many of his
fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite Carnaval, and
Chopin later dedicated his Ballade No. 2 in F major to Schumann. Elements of
Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works.^[58] Liszt later
transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship
was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was
deeply affected by Chopin's death.^[177]

Two of Chopin's long-standing pupils, Karol Mikuli (1821–1897) and Georges
Mathias, were themselves piano teachers and passed on details of his playing to
their own students, some of whom (such as Raoul Koczalski) were to make
recordings of his music. Other pianists and composers influenced by Chopin's
style include Louis Moreau Gottschalk, Édouard Wolff (1816–1880) and Pierre
Zimmermann.^[178] Debussy dedicated his own 1915 piano Études to the memory of
Chopin; he frequently played Chopin's music during his studies at the Paris
Conservatoire, and undertook the editing of Chopin's piano music for the
publisher Jacques Durand.^[179]

[150px-Pomnik_Frydery]

Polish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as Moritz
Moszkowski, but, in the opinion of J. Barrie Jones, his "one worthy successor"
among his compatriots was Karol Szymanowski (1882–1937).^[180] Edvard Grieg,
Antonín Dvořák, Isaac Albéniz, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Sergei Rachmaninoff
, among others, are regarded by critics as having been influenced by Chopin's
use of national modes and idioms.^[181] Alexander Scriabin was devoted to the
music of Chopin, and his early published works include nineteen mazurkas, as
well as numerous études and preludes; his teacher Nikolai Zverev drilled him in
Chopin's works to improve his virtuosity as a performer.^[182] In the 20th
century, composers who paid homage to (or in some cases parodied) the music of
Chopin included George Crumb, Bohuslav Martinů, Darius Milhaud, Igor Stravinsky
^[183] and Heitor Villa-Lobos.^[184]

Chopin's music was used in the 1909 ballet Chopiniana, choreographed by Michel
Fokine and orchestrated by Alexander Glazunov. Sergei Diaghilev commissioned
additional orchestrations—from Stravinsky, Anatoly Lyadov, Sergei Taneyev and
Nikolai Tcherepnin—for later productions, which used the title Les Sylphides.^
[185]

Chopin's music remains very popular and is regularly performed, recorded and
broadcast worldwide. The world's oldest monographic music competition, the
International Chopin Piano Competition, founded in 1927, is held every five
years in Warsaw.^[186] The Fryderyk Chopin Institute of Poland lists on its
website over eighty societies worldwide devoted to the composer and his music.^
[187] The Institute site also lists nearly 1,500 performances of Chopin works
on YouTube as of January 2014.^[188]

Recordings

The British Library notes that "Chopin's works have been recorded by all the
great pianists of the recording era." The earliest recording was an 1895
performance by Paul Pabst of the Nocturne in E major Op. 62 No. 2. The British
Library site makes available a number of historic recordings, including some by
Alfred Cortot, Ignaz Friedman, Vladimir Horowitz, Benno Moiseiwitsch, Ignacy
Jan Paderewski, Arthur Rubinstein, Xaver Scharwenka and many others.^[189] A
select discography of recordings of Chopin works by pianists representing the
various pedagogic traditions stemming from Chopin is given by Methuen-Campbell
in his work tracing the lineage and character of those traditions.^[190]

Numerous recordings of Chopin's works are available. On the occasion of the
composer's bicentenary, the critics of The New York Times recommended
performances by the following contemporary pianists (among many others):^[191]
Martha Argerich, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Emanuel Ax, Evgeny Kissin, Murray Perahia,
Maurizio Pollini and Krystian Zimerman. The Warsaw Chopin Society organizes the
Grand prix du disque de F. Chopin for notable Chopin recordings, held every
five years.^[192]

In literature, stage, film and television

Chopin's grave at Père-Lachaise cemetery, Paris

Chopin has figured extensively in Polish literature, both in serious critical
studies of his life and music and in fictional treatments. The earliest
manifestation was probably an 1830 sonnet on Chopin by Leon Ulrich. French
writers on Chopin (apart from Sand) have included Marcel Proust and André Gide;
and he has also featured in works of Gottfried Benn and Boris Pasternak.^[193]
There are numerous biographies of Chopin in English (see bibliography for some
of these).

Possibly the first venture into fictional treatments of Chopin's life was a
fanciful operatic version of some of its events. Chopin was written by Giacomo
Orefice and produced in Milan in 1901. All the music is derived from that of
Chopin.^[194]

Chopin's life and his relations with George Sand have been fictionalized in
numerous films. The 1945 biographical film A Song to Remember earned Cornel
Wilde an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor for his portrayal of the
composer. Other film treatments have included: La valse de l'adieu (France,
1928) by Henry Roussel, with Pierre Blanchar as Chopin; Impromptu (1991),
starring Hugh Grant as Chopin; La note bleue (1991); and Chopin: Desire for
Love (2002).^[195]

Chopin's life was covered in a BBC TV documentary Chopin – The Women Behind The
Music (2010),^[196] and in a 2010 documentary realised by Angelo Bozzolini and
Roberto Prosseda for Italian television.^[197]

    was "born 1 March 1810 at the village of Żelazowa Wola in the Province of

    Russian troops during the January 1863 Uprising.^[22]

 8. ^ Two neighbouring apartments at the Valldemossa monastery, each long
    hosting a Chopin museum, have been claimed to be the retreat of Chopin and
    Sand, and to hold Chopin's Pleyel piano. In 2011 a Spanish court on
    Majorca, partly by ruling out a piano that had been built after Chopin's
    visit there—probably after his death—decided which was the correct
    apartment.^[73]
 9. ^ In 1879 the heart was sealed within a pillar of the Holy Cross Church,
    behind a tablet carved by Leonard Marconi.^[116] During the German invasion
    of Warsaw in World War II, the heart was removed for safekeeping and held
    in the quarters of the German commander, Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski. It
    was later returned to the church authorities but it was not yet considered
    safe to return it to its former resting place. It was taken to the town of
    Milanówek, where the casket was opened and the heart was viewed (its large
    size was noted). It was stored in St. Hedwig's Church there. On 17 October
    1945, the 96th anniversary of Chopin's death, it was returned to its place
    in Holy Cross Church.^[117]
