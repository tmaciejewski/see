Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an
English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and
theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the development of
theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of
algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a
model of a general purpose computer.^[2]^[3]^[4] Turing is widely considered to
be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.^[5]

During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher
School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre. For a time he
led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a
number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including
improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine
that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role
in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the
Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic; it has
been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two
years and saved over fourteen million lives.^[6]

After the war, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed
the ACE, among the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948 Turing
joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of
Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers^[7] and became
interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of
morphogenesis, and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the
Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.

Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when by the Labouchere
Amendment, "gross indecency" was still criminal in the UK. He accepted chemical
castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in
1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest
determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence
is also consistent with accidental poisoning.^[8] In 2009, following an
Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public
apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was
treated." Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013.^[9]^[10]^

Early life

Turing was born in Maida Vale, London, while his father, Julius Mathison Turing
(1873–1947), was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service (ICS)
at Chhatrapur, Bihar and Orissa Province, in British India.^[12]^[13] Turing's
father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev. John Robert Turing, from a Scottish
family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a
baronet. Turing's mother, Julius' wife, was Ethel Sara (née Stoney; 1881–1976),
daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways. The
Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary
and County Longford, while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in
County Clare.^[14]

Julius' work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his
grandfather had been a general in the Bengal Army. However, both Julius and
Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to Maida
Vale,^[15] London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a
blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth,^[16]^[17] later the
Colonnade Hotel.^[12]^[18] He had an elder brother, John (the father of Sir
John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets).

Turing's father's civil service commission was still active and during Turing's
childhood years Turing's parents travelled between Hastings in England^[19] and
India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings,
Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked
with a blue plaque.

Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to
display prominently.^[20] His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927,
and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with
a blue plaque.^[21]

Education

School

Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a day school at 20 Charles Road,
St Leonards-on-Sea, at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent
early on, as did many of his subsequent educators. In 1926, at the age of 13,
he went on to Sherborne School, an independent school in the market town of
Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General
Strike in Britain, but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle
unaccompanied 60 miles (97 km) from Southampton to Sherborne, stopping
overnight at an inn.^[22]

Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him
respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education
placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents: "I
hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he
must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist,
he is wasting his time at a public school".^[23] Despite this, Turing continued
to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems
in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928, aged 16,
Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is
possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of
motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.^[24]

Christopher Morcom

At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil
Christopher Morcom, who has been described as Turing's "first love". Their
relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut
short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications of bovine
tuberculosis, contracted after drinking infected cow's milk some years
previously.^[25]^[26]^[27]

The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that
much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with
Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother Turing said:

    I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant
    and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and
    in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be
    shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me ... I know I
    must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were
    alive, because that is what he would like me to do.^[28]

Some have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's atheism and
materialism.^[29] Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in
such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death. In a
later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing said:

    Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter
    but certainly not by the same kind of body ... as regards the actual
    connection between spirit and body I consider that the body [can] hold on
    to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly
    connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the
    body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the
    spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately.^[30]

University and work on computability

After Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King's
College, Cambridge, whence he gained first-class honours in mathematics. In
1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a fellow of King's on the strength of a
dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.^[31] Unbeknownst to
the committee, the theorem had already been proven, in 1922, by Jarl Waldemar
Lindeberg.^[32]

In 1936, Turing published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application
to the Entscheidungsproblem" (1936).^[33] In this paper, Turing reformulated
Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing
Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple
hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. Entscheidungsproblem
(decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert
in 1928. Turing proved that his "universal computing machine" would be capable
of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable
as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision
problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is
undecidable: It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing
machine will ever halt.

[220px-20130808_Kings_College_F]
 
King's College, Cambridge, where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a
Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him.

Although Turing's proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church's equivalent
proof^[34] using his lambda calculus, Turing's approach is considerably more
accessible and intuitive than Church's.^[35] It also included a notion of a
'Universal Machine' (now known as a universal Turing machine), with the idea
that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine
(as indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the Church–Turing
thesis, Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing
anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central
concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper.^[36] To this day,
Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation.

From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under
Church at Princeton University. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he
studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical
binary multiplier.^[37] In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from Princeton;^[38]
his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals,^[39]^[40] introduced the
concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, where Turing
machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing the study of problems
that cannot be solved by Turing machines. John von Neumann wanted to hire him
as his postdoctoral assistant, but he went back to England.^[41]

When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig
Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics.^[42] Remarkably, the
lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing
and other students, from students' notes.^[43] Turing and Wittgenstein argued
and disagreed, with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his
view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but rather invents
them.^[44]

Cryptanalysis

During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking
of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa
Briggs has said, "You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley
and Turing's was that genius."^[45] From September 1938, Turing had been
working part-time with the GC&CS, the British code breaking organisation. He
concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS
codebreaker.^[46] Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish
Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the
wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages,
Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem.^[47]
The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans
were likely to change, which they did in May 1940. Turing's approach was more
general, using crib-based decryption for which he produced the functional
specification of the bombe (an improvement of the Polish Bomba).^[48]

and 1940, before moving to Hut 8.

On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing
reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&CS.^[49] Specifying the
bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made
during the war. The others were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the
German navy; developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient
use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus; developing a procedure for working out
the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40/42 (Tunny) dubbed Turingery
and, towards the end of the war, the development of a portable secure voice
scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah.

By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different
possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing made an innovative
contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical
approaches, titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography^[50] and
Paper on Statistics of Repetitions,^[51] which were of such value to GC&CS and
its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives
until April 2012, shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ
mathematician, "who identified himself only as Richard," said at the time that
the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated
their importance, and their relevance to post-war cryptanalysis:^[52]

    [He] said the fact that the contents had been restricted "shows what a
    tremendous importance it has in the foundations of our subject". … The
    papers detailed using "mathematical analysis to try and determine which are
    the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible."
    … Richard said that GCHQ had now "squeezed the juice" out of the two papers
    and was "happy for them to be released into the public domain".

Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was
known to his colleagues as 'Prof' and his treatise on Enigma was known as 'The
Prof's Book'.^[53] Jack Good, a cryptanalyst who worked with him, is quoted by
Ronald Lewin as having said of Turing:

    In the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever,
    and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the
    pollen off. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular
    intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times
    the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the
    chain by hand. Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to
    the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen.^[54]

While working at Bletchley, Turing, who was a talented long-distance runner,
occasionally ran the 40 miles (64 km) to London when he was needed for
high-level meetings,^[55] and he was capable of world-class marathon standards.
^[56]^[57] Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team, hampered by an
injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than
British silver medallist Thomas Richards' Olympic race time of 2 hours 35
minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club's best runner, a fact discovered when he
passed the group while running alone.^[58]^[59]^[60]

In 1945, Turing was awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime services,
but his work remained secret for many years.^[61]

Bombe

Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,^[49] Turing had specified an
electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma more effectively than
the Polish bomba kryptologiczna, from which its name was derived. The bombe,
with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman, became one of
the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack
Enigma-enciphered messages.

Jack Good opined:

    Turing's most important contribution, I think, was of part of the design of
    the bombe, the cryptanalytic machine. He had the idea that you could use,
    in effect, a theorem in logic which sounds, to the untrained ear, rather
    absurd; namely that, from a contradiction, you can deduce everything.^[62]

[220px-Bombe-rebuild]

Bletchley Park

The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message
(i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings), using a suitable
crib: a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors
(which had on the order of 10^19 states, or 10^22 states for the four-rotor
U-boat variant),^[63] the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based
on the crib, implemented electromechanically.

The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that
setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause
contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in
detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned
back into the same plaintext letter - this simply wasn't possible with the
Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.^[64]

By late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, Hugh
Alexander, and Stuart Milner-Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the
Poles, they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but
they only had a few people and a few bombes, so they did not have time to
translate all the signals. In the summer, they had had considerable success,
and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month, but they were
still on a knife-edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of
German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes
through the proper channels, but they were getting nowhere. Finally, breaking
all the rules, on 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill spelling
out their difficulties, with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how
small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the
forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the
forces.^[65]

As Andrew Hodges, biographer of Turing, later wrote, "This letter had an
electric effect."^[66] Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay, which read:
"ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and
report to me that this has been done." On 18 November, the chief of the secret
service reported that every possible measure was being taken.^[66] The
cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister's response,
but as Milner-Barry later recalled, "All that we did notice was that almost
from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth."^[67] More
than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war.^[68]

Hut 8 and the naval Enigma

Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval
Enigma "because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to
myself".^[70] In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval
indicator system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the
other services.^[70]^[71]

That same night, he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus, a sequential
statistical technique (what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis) to
assist in breaking the naval Enigma, "though I was not sure that it would work
in practice, and was not, in fact, sure until some days had actually broken."^
[70] For this, he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the
ban. Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors,
substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes.

In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke, a fellow
mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After
admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly "unfazed" by the
revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.^[72]

Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942^[73] and worked with US
Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington; he
also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio.

Turing's reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic:

    The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel
    order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine
    implied by this programme, but thought that no particular purpose would be
    served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way.

    Their test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they
    were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices.
    Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they
    are really going to do something about it.^[74]

During this trip, he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure
speech devices.^[75] He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his
absence, Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8,
although Alexander had been de facto head for some time (Turing having little
interest in the day-to-day running of the section). Turing then became a
general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.

Alexander wrote this about Turing's contribution:

    There should be no question in anyone's mind that Turing's work was the
    biggest factor in Hut 8's success. In the early days, he was the only
    cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he
    primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut, but he
    also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of
    the bombe. It is always difficult to say that anyone is 'absolutely
    indispensable', but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8, it was Turing.
    The pioneer's work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine
    later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the
    magnitude of Turing's contribution was never fully realised by the outside
    world.^[76]

Turingery

In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed Turingery (or jokingly
Turingismus)^[77] for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the
Germans' new Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machine. This was a teleprinter
rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a
method of wheel-breaking, i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of
Tunny's wheels.^[78] He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who,
under the guidance of Max Newman, went on to build the Colossus computer, the
world's first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a
simpler prior machine (the Heath Robinson), and whose superior speed allowed
the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages.^
[79] Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of
the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus
undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher,^
[80]^[81] but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development.^[82]

Delilah

Following his work at Bell Labs in the US,^[83] Turing pursued the idea of
electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system, and in the latter
part of the war, he moved to work for the Secret Service's Radio Security
Service (later HMGCC) at Hanslope Park. There he further developed his
knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley.
Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice
communications machine codenamed Delilah.^[84] It was intended for different
applications, lacking capability for use with long-distance radio
transmissions, and in any case, Delilah was completed too late to be used
during the war. Though the system worked fully, with Turing demonstrating it to
officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill
speech, Delilah was not adopted for use.^[85] Turing also consulted with Bell
Labs on the development of SIGSALY, a secure voice system that was used in the
later years of the war.

Early computers and the Turing test

[220px-Alan_Turing_78_High_Stre]
 
Plaque, 78 High Street, Hampton

From 1945 to 1947, Turing lived in Hampton, London,^[86] while he worked on the
design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical
Laboratory (NPL). He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first
detailed design of a stored-program computer.^[87] Von Neumann's incomplete
First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing's paper, but it was
much less detailed and, according to John R. Womersley, Superintendent of the
NPL Mathematics Division, it "contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing's
own".^[88] Although ACE was a feasible design, the secrecy surrounding the
wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he
became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical
year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was
not published in his lifetime.^[89] While he was at Cambridge, the Pilot ACE
was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950,
and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it, including the
English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G-15. The full version of
Turing's ACE was not built until after his death.^[90]

According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the
Max Planck Institute for Physics, published by Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was
a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse.^[91] It took place in Göttingen
in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were
Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse,
Walther, and Billing. (For more details see Herbert Bruderer, Konrad Zuse und
die Schweiz).

In 1948 Turing was appointed Reader in the Mathematics Department at the
Victoria University of Manchester. In 1949, he became Deputy Director of the
Computing Machine Laboratory there, working on software for one of the earliest
stored-program computers—the Manchester Mark 1. During this time he continued
to do more abstract work in mathematics,^[92] and in "Computing Machinery and
Intelligence" (Mind, October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of artificial
intelligence, and proposed an experiment that became known as the Turing test,
an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called "intelligent". The
idea was that a computer could be said to "think" if a human interrogator could
not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being.^[93] In the paper,
Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult
mind, it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child's
mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A reversed form of the
Turing test is widely used on the Internet; the CAPTCHA test is intended to
determine whether the user is a human or a computer.

In 1948 Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, D. G.
Champernowne, began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet
exist. By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp.^[94] In
1952, he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1, but lacking enough power,
the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead, Turing played a game
in which he simulated the computer, taking about half an hour per move. The
game was recorded.^[95] The program lost to Turing's colleague Alick Glennie,
although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne's wife.

His Turing test was a significant, characteristically provocative and lasting
contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence, which continues
after more than half a century.^[96] He also invented the LU decomposition
method in 1948,^[92] used today for solving matrix equations.^[97]

Pattern formation and mathematical biology

Towards the end of his life, Turing turned to mathematical biology, publishing
the "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" in 1952. He was interested in
morphogenesis, the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms.
His central interest in the field was understanding Fibonacci phyllotaxis, the
existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures.^[98] He suggested that a
system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed
a reaction-diffusion system, could account for "the main phenomena of
morphogenesis".^[99] Instability in the system of partial differential
equations used to model the system allows for small random perturbations to
homogeneous initial state to drive the development of patterns. Though
published before even the structure or role of DNA was understood, Turing's
work on morphogenesis remains relevant today, and is considered a seminal piece
of work in mathematical biology.^[100] Experiments suggest that Turing's work
can partially explain growth of "feathers, hair follicles, the branching
pattern of lungs, and even the left-right asymmetry that puts the heart on the
left side of the chest."^[101] In 2012, Sheth, et al. found that in mice,
removal of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an
increase in the overall size of the limb, suggesting that Hox genes control
digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turing-type mechanism.^[102]
Later papers, though promised, were not available until Collected Works of
A. M. Turing was published in 1992.^[103]

Conviction for indecency

In January 1952, Turing, then 39, started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a
19-year-old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before Christmas outside
the Regal Cinema when walking down Manchester's Oxford Road and invited him to
lunch. On 23 January Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the
burglar was an acquaintance of his, and Turing reported the crime to the
police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with
Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that
time,^[104] and both men were charged with gross indecency under Section 11 of
the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885.^[105] Initial committal proceedings for
the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor "reserved
his defence", i.e. did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations.

Later, convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, Turing
entered a plea of guilty.^[106] The case, Regina v. Turing and Murray, was
brought to trial on 31 March 1952.^[107] Turing was convicted and given a
choice between imprisonment and probation, which would be conditional on his
agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido. He accepted
the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol
(now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES), a synthetic oestrogen; this treatment
was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing
impotent and caused gynaecomastia,^[108] fulfilling in the literal sense
Turing's prediction that "no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man,
but quite who I've not found out".^[109]^[110] Murray was given a conditional
discharge.^[111]

Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him
from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government
Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British signals intelligence agency
that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946 (though he kept his academic job). He was
denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free
to visit other European countries. At the time, there was acute public anxiety
about homosexual entrapment of spies by Soviet agents,^[112] because of the
recent exposure of the first two members of the Cambridge Five, Guy Burgess and
Donald Maclean, as KGB double agents. Turing was never accused of espionage,
but in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park, he was prevented by
the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work.^[113]

Death

On 8 June 1954, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous
day. A post-mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide
poisoning. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his
bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,^[114] it was speculated
that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest
determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at Woking
Crematorium on 12 June 1954.^[115] Turing's ashes were scattered there, just as
his father's had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer, David Leavitt,
have both suggested that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the Walt Disney
film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his favourite fairy tale, both
noting that (in Leavitt's words) he took "an especially keen pleasure in the
scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew".^[116]

Alternative death theories

Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the
coroner's historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the
cause of Turing's death, this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes
from an apparatus for gold electroplating spoons, which uses potassium cyanide
to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare
room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with
inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an
apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten.^
[117] In addition, Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone
treatment (which had been discontinued a year previously) "with good humour"
and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death, even setting down a
list of tasks he intended to complete upon return to his office after the
holiday weekend.^[117] At the time, Turing's mother believed that the ingestion
was accidental, resulting from her son's careless storage of laboratory
chemicals.^[118] Going even further, biographer Andrew Hodges suggests Turing
arranged the cyanide experiment deliberately to allow his mother plausible
deniability.^[119]

Recognition and tributes

A biography published by the Royal Society shortly after Turing's death, while
his wartime work was still subject to the Official Secrets Act, recorded:

    Three remarkable papers written just before the war, on three diverse
    mathematical subjects, show the quality of the work that might have been
    produced if he had settled down to work on some big problem at that
    critical time. For his work at the Foreign Office he was awarded the OBE.^
    [2]

Since 1966, the Turing Award has been given annually by the Association for
Computing Machinery for technical or theoretical contributions to the computing
community. It is widely considered to be the computing world's highest honour,
equivalent to the Nobel Prize.^[120]

On 23 June 1998, on what would have been Turing's 86th birthday, his
biographer, Andrew Hodges, unveiled an official English Heritage blue plaque at
his birthplace and childhood home in Warrington Crescent, London, later the
Colonnade Hotel.^[121]^[122] To mark the 50th anniversary of his death, a
memorial plaque was unveiled on 7 June 2004 at his former residence,
Hollymeade, in Wilmslow, Cheshire.^[123]

[220px-Turing_Plaque]

On 13 March 2000, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines issued a set of postage
stamps to celebrate the greatest achievements of the 20th century, one of which
carries a portrait of Turing against a background of repeated 0s and 1s, and is
captioned: "1937: Alan Turing's theory of digital computing". On 1 April 2003,
Turing's work at Bletchley Park was named an IEEE Milestone.^[124] On 28
October 2004, a bronze statue of Alan Turing sculpted by John W. Mills was
unveiled at the University of Surrey in Guildford, marking the 50th anniversary
of Turing's death; it portrays him carrying his books across the campus.^[125]

Turing was one of four mathematicians examined in the BBC documentary entitled
Dangerous Knowledge (2008).^[126] The Princeton Alumni Weekly named Turing the
second most significant alumnus in the history of Princeton University, second
only to President James Madison. A 1.5-ton, life-size statue of Turing was
unveiled on 19 June 2007 at Bletchley Park. Built from approximately half a
million pieces of Welsh slate, it was sculpted by Stephen Kettle, having been
commissioned by the American billionaire Sidney Frank.^[127]

Turing has been honoured in various ways in Manchester, the city where he
worked towards the end of his life. In 1994, a stretch of the A6010 road (the
Manchester city intermediate ring road) was named "Alan Turing Way". A bridge
carrying this road was widened, and carries the name Alan Turing Bridge. A
statue of Turing was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in Sackville Park,
between the University of Manchester building on Whitworth Street and Canal
Street. The memorial statue depicts the "father of computer science" sitting on
a bench at a central position in the park. Turing is shown holding an apple.
The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text 'Alan Mathison Turing
1912–1954', and the motto 'Founder of Computer Science' as it could appear if
encoded by an Enigma machine: 'IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ'.

[220px-Sackville_Park_Turing_pl]

A plaque at the statue's feet reads 'Father of computer science, mathematician,
logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice'. There is also a Bertrand
Russell quotation: "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but
supreme beauty — a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture." The
sculptor buried his own old Amstrad computer under the plinth as a tribute to
"the godfather of all modern computers".^[128]

In 1999, Time magazine named Turing as one of the 100 Most Important People of
the 20th century and stated, "The fact remains that everyone who taps at a
keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an
incarnation of a Turing machine."^[3]

In 2002, Turing was ranked twenty-first on the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest
Britons following a UK-wide vote.^[129] In 2006, British writer and
mathematician Ioan James chose Turing as one of twenty people to feature in his
book about famous historical figures who may have had some of the traits of
Asperger syndrome.^[130] In 2010, actor/playwright Jade Esteban Estrada
portrayed Turing in the solo musical, ICONS: The Lesbian and Gay History of the
World, Vol. 4. In 2011, in The Guardian's "My hero" series, writer Alan Garner
chose Turing as his hero and described how they had met whilst out jogging in
the early 1950s. Garner remembered Turing as "funny and witty" and said that he
"talked endlessly".^[131] In 2006, Alan Turing was named with online resources
as an LGBT History Month Icon.^[132] In 2006, Boston Pride named Turing their
Honorary Grand Marshal.^[133]

[170px-Alan_Turing_Memor]

The logo of Apple Inc. is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to Alan
Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his death.^[134] Both the designer of
the logo^[135] and the company deny that there is any homage to Turing in the
design.^[136]^[137] Stephen Fry has recounted asking Steve Jobs whether the
design was intentional, saying that Jobs' response was, "God, we wish it were."
^[138] In February 2011, Turing's papers from the Second World War were bought
for the nation with an 11th-hour bid by the National Heritage Memorial Fund,
allowing them to stay at Bletchley Park.^[139]

In 2012, Turing was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display
that celebrates LGBT history and people.^[140]^[141]

The francophone singer-songwriter Salvatore Adamo made a tribute to Turing with
his song "Alan et la Pomme".^[142] Turing's life and work featured in a BBC
children's programme about famous scientists – Absolute Genius with Dick and
Dom – first broadcast on 12 March 2014.

On 17 May 2014, the world's first work of public art to recognise Alan Turing
as gay was commissioned in Bletchley, close by to Bletchley Park where his
war-time work was carried out. The commission was announced by the owners of
Milton Keynes-based LGBT venue and nightclub Pink Punters to mark International
Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia. The work was unveiled at a ceremony on
Turing's birthday, 23 June 2014, and is placed outside Pink Punter's alongside
the busy Watling Street, the old main road to London where Turing himself would
have passed by on many occasions. On 22 October 2014, Turing was inducted into
the NSA Hall of Honor.^[143]^[144]

Government apology and pardon

In August 2009, John Graham-Cumming started a petition urging the British
Government to apologise for Turing's prosecution as a homosexual.^[168]^[169]
The petition received more than 30,000 signatures.^[170]^[171] Prime Minister
Gordon Brown acknowledged the petition, releasing a statement on 10 September
2009 apologising and describing the treatment of Turing as "appalling":^[170]^
[172]

    Thousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing
    and recognition of the appalling way he was treated. While Turing was dealt
    with under the law of the time and we can't put the clock back, his
    treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance
    to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him ... So on
    behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to
    Alan's work I am very proud to say: we're sorry, you deserved so much
    better.^[170]^[173]

In December 2011, William Jones created an e-petition^[174] requesting the
British Government pardon Turing for his conviction of "gross indecency":^[175]

    We ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Alan Turing for the
    conviction of "gross indecency". In 1952, he was convicted of "gross
    indecency" with another man and was forced to undergo so-called
    "organo-therapy" – chemical castration. Two years later, he killed himself
    with cyanide, aged just 41. Alan Turing was driven to a terrible despair
    and early death by the nation he'd done so much to save. This remains a
    shame on the British government and British history. A pardon can go some
    way to healing this damage. It may act as an apology to many of the other
    gay men, not as well-known as Alan Turing, who were subjected to these
    laws.^[174]

The petition gathered over 37,000 signatures,^[11]^[174] but the request was
discouraged by Lord McNally, who gave the following opinion in his role as the
Justice Minister:^[176]

    A posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing was
    properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence. He would
    have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be
    prosecuted. It is tragic that Alan Turing was convicted of an offence that
    now seems both cruel and absurd—particularly poignant given his outstanding
    contribution to the war effort. However, the law at the time required a
    prosecution and, as such, long-standing policy has been to accept that such
    convictions took place and, rather than trying to alter the historical
    context and to put right what cannot be put right, ensure instead that we
    never again return to those times.^[177]

John Leech, the MP for Manchester Withington (2005–15), submitted several bills
to Parliament^[178] and campaigned with William Jones to secure the pardon.
Leech made the case in the House of Commons that Turing's contribution to the
war made him a national hero and that it was "ultimately just embarrassing"
that the conviction still stood.^[179] Leech continued to take the bill through
Parliament and campaigned for several years until it was passed.^[180]

On 26 July 2012, a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to grant a
statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law
Amendment Act 1885, of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952.^[181] Late in
the year in a letter to The Daily Telegraph, the physicist Stephen Hawking and
10 other signatories including the Astronomer Royal Lord Rees, President of the
Royal Society Sir Paul Nurse, Lady Trumpington (who worked for Turing during
the war) and Lord Sharkey (the bill's sponsor) called on Prime Minister David
Cameron to act on the pardon request.^[182] The Government indicated it would
support the bill,^[183]^[184]^[185] and it passed its third reading in the
Lords in October.^[186]

[40px] Wikinews has related news: Alan Turing given posthumous pardon

Before the bill could be debated in the House of Commons,^[187] the Government
elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy. On 24 December 2013,
Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon^[10] for Turing's conviction for gross
indecency, with immediate effect. Announcing the pardon, Justice Secretary
Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be "remembered and recognised for his
fantastic contribution to the war effort" and not for his later criminal
conviction.^[9]^[11] The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August
2014.^[188] The Queen's action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since
the conclusion of the Second World War.^[189] This case is unusual in that
pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent, and
a request has been made by the family or other interested party. Neither
condition was met in regard to Turing's conviction.^[190]

In a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron after announcement of the pardon,
human rights advocate Peter Tatchell criticised the decision to single out
Turing due to his fame and achievements, when thousands of others convicted
under the same law have not received pardons.^[191] Tatchell also called for a
new investigation into Turing's death:

    A new inquiry is long overdue, even if only to dispel any doubts about the
    true cause of his death – including speculation that he was murdered by the
    security services (or others). I think murder by state agents is unlikely.
    There is no known evidence pointing to any such act. However, it is a major
    failing that this possibility has never been considered or investigated.^
    [192]

In September 2016, the government announced its intention to expand this
retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency
offenses, in what has been described as an "Alan Turing law".^[193]^[194]

To mark the 100th anniversary of Turing's birth, the Turing Centenary Advisory
Committee (TCAC) co-ordinated the Alan Turing Year, a year-long programme of
events around the world honouring Turing's life and achievements. The TCAC,
chaired by S. Barry Cooper with Alan Turing's nephew Sir John Dermot Turing
acting as Honorary President, worked with the University of Manchester faculty
members and a broad spectrum of people from Cambridge University and Bletchley
Park.

On 23 June 2012, Google featured an interactive doodle where visitors had to
change the instructions of a Turing Machine, so when run, the symbols on the
tape would match a provided sequence, featuring "Google" in Baudot-Murray code.
^[195]

The Bletchley Park Trust collaborated with Winning Moves to publish an Alan
Turing edition of the board game Monopoly. The game's squares and cards have
been revised to tell the story of Alan Turing's life, from his birthplace in
Maida Vale to Hut 8 at Bletchley Park.^[196] The game also includes a replica
of an original hand-drawn board created by William Newman, son of Turing's
mentor, Max Newman, which Turing played on in the 1950s.^[197]

    dudoso. Recital para Alan Turing (A dubious binary digit. Concert for Alan
    Turing) to the memory of the mathematician.^[217]
  • A musical work inspired by Turing's life, written by Neil Tennant and Chris
    Lowe of the Pet Shop Boys, entitled A Man from the Future, was announced in
    late 2013.^[218] It was performed by the Pet Shop Boys and Juliet Stevenson
    (narrator), the BBC Singers, and the BBC Concert Orchestra conducted by
    Dominic Wheeler at the BBC Proms in the Royal Albert Hall on 23 July 2014.^
    [219]
  • Codebreaker is also the title of a choral work by the composer James
    McCarthy. It includes settings of texts by the poets Wilfred Owen, Sara
    Teasdale, Walt Whitman, Oscar Wilde and Robert Burns that are used to
    illustrate aspects of Turing's life. It was premiered on 26 April 2014 at
    the Barbican Centre in London, where it was performed by the Hertfordshire
    Chorus, who commissioned the work, led by David Temple with the soprano
    soloist Naomi Harvey providing the voice of Turing's mother.^[220]^[221]

Film

  • The historical drama film The Imitation Game, directed by Morten Tyldum and
    starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing and Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke,
    was released in the UK on 14 November 2014 and released theatrically in the
    US on 28 November 2014. It is about Alan Turing breaking the Enigma code
    with other codebreakers in Bletchley Park.^[222]^[223]^[224]^[225]

  • Turing, Sara Stoney (1959). Alan M Turing. W Heffer.  Turing's mother, who

    war work. Scarcely 300 copies were sold (Sara Turing to Lyn Newman, 1967,
    Library of St John's College, Cambridge). The six-page foreword by Lyn
    Irvine includes reminiscences and is more frequently quoted. It was
    re-published by Cambridge University Press in 2012, to honour the centenary
    of his birth, and included a new foreword by Martin Davis, as well as a
